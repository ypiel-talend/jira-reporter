= Jira Reporter

== Configuration

Jira Reporter is a CLI but configuration can be hardcoded in `~/.jira-reporter.properties`.
You can use base64 encoding for data you don't want to store in clear:

[source,properties]
----
base-url = https://jira.talendforge.org
password = base64:xxxxx
jql = labels = xxxx
exclude-status = closed,resolved,development done,qa done,done
----

== Usage

Just runt the crest Main with the options of the command line (you can use `help` to know the detail):

[source,sh]
----
java -jar jira-reporter.jar \
  jira report --output=/home/me/graph.html
----

Then open the output in any browser.

== Build

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean install
----
